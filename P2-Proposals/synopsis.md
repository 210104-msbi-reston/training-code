# COVID-19 Data Analysis
## Context and Goals
Our project will collect, process and analyze data from open sources COVID-19 cases and deaths to determine vaccine distribution priorities. The result of the project will be the creation of an informational guide with detailed recommendations for the US government on the distribution of vaccines by region (districts, cities, states), gender, race and age. The generated guide will be presented as report into a PDF file.
